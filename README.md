DoMeteor by VividCloud.
========

Another Meteor Docker Deployment. (Need DaoCloud build environment)

## Usage

Copy these files to your project directory:

```
daocloud.yml
Dockerfile.buildtime
Dockerfile.runtime
```

And then build your project on DaoCloud. You may need to switch the `构建流程` manually to `daocloud.yml`.

## Todo

* [ ] Easier project pre-configuration.
* [ ] Faster build times.
